- research new EE value from @wisi (data collection)
  - seems done, F520 values correlates with EE version. 6 EE revision and 5 F520, EE 3.0 and 3.1 has the same value
- add ROM CRC database (BOOT and DVD), mostly for redump database
- CRC values can be used for detecting modchips
- add ability to dump keys (all serials + HDD key) into separate file
- add additional field for network adapters for FAT models (including non-official)
- split network adapter, so al possible official adapters will be shown
- or at least add gamestar detection
- add first 3 bytes of MAC address into database
- fix some SPU2 chips
